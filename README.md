Luajit For Python
----------------------
Am performing sacrilege by modifying Luajit's internals to experiment with Python. With this version of Luajit, am modifying the lexer and parser to support simple functions, while, if-else, lists etc.
Am adding to the tests folder for things which are working.
This project right now is just for fun. Let me know if you would like to collaborate.
